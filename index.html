                Tamaulipas is a state in northeast Mexico, bordering Texas (USA).
                It has industrial cities like Reynosa and Matamoros, the capital
                Ciudad Victoria, and the important port of Tampico. The state's
                economy includes factories, oil, and farming (citrus fruits, sorghum).
                It has beautiful beaches like Miramar and the "El Cielo" Biosphere
                Reserve with rich wildlife. Tamaulipas is important for trade
                because of its location near the USA.
